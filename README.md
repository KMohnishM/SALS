## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- OpenRouter API key
- LangSmith API key
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SALS
```

2. Backend Setup:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Frontend Setup:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
HTTP_REFERER=http://localhost:8000
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=adaptive-learning-platform
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
```

5. Run migrations:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Start the development servers:

Backend:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The backend server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
